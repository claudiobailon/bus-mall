# bus-mall
This app builds a website to test products for BusMall.  The website shows you three random 
images of products that BusMall offers and asks you to pick which one you are most interested
in.  It does this 25 times, never showing the same image twice in a row, then displays the results
in two charts when you are done.  The first chart is a horizantal bar chart that compares the amount
of times a product is clicked on vs how many times it is shown. The second chart displays the same informtion in a radar chart.  

The data on how often a product was clicked is stored in local storage to compile more and more data. 
The user has the option to push a button at the top of the chart to retake the survey or clear the 
data, if they so desire.
